## Purpose of this Worksheet

This worksheet is to be completed **individually**.

The goal is to:
- reason independently about the system,
- explore alternative viewpoints,
- contribute meaningfully to the team-level UML artifacts.

Your answers need not be perfect or final — they will be **discussed and refined at the group level**.

---

## Part A: System Boundaries (Individual)

### A1. Entities *Inside* the System
(List responsibilities of the embedded system itself)

-  
-  
-  
-  

### A2. Entities *Outside* the System
(List users, sensors, actuators, other systems, environment)

-  
-  
-  
-  

### A3. Assumptions
(List assumptions about environment, timing, users, power, data quality)

-

-

## Part B: Actors and Interfaces (Individual)

Identify key actors that interact with the system and the interfaces involved.

| Actor / External Entity | Type (User / Sensor / Actuator / System) | Interface(s) (Data / Control / Signal) |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|.                        |                                           |                                        |
|.                        |                                           |                                        |
|.                        |                                           |                                        |
|.                        |                                           |                                        |

## Part C: Use Cases (Individual)

Describe **at least three use cases** that capture important system behavior.

Each use case should describe:
- a goal,
- a primary actor,
- a short description, including trigger, success scenario and alternate scenario

| Use Case ID | Use Case Name | Primary Actor | Brief Description |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| UC-1        |               |               |                   |
| UC-2        |               |               |                   |
| UC-3        |               |               |                   |

---

## Part D: Behavioral Insights (Individual Reflection)

Answer briefly (3–4 sentences):

1. Which part of the system behavior was **hardest to reason about**?
2. Did you discover any **missing, unclear, or conflicting requirements** while thinking about behavior?

---

## Submission Notes

- This worksheet is submitted **individually**.
- It will be used by your team to:
  - select actors,
  - choose representative use cases,
  - construct the system context diagram,
  - build the UML statechart.

## Reminder

> Good behavioral models begin with clear system boundaries and concrete use cases.
